/*
 * dec406: streaming decoder for first-generation Cospas-Sarsat 406 MHz beacon
 * messages, fed with FM-discriminator audio samples (the BK4829 RAW RX audio as
 * read on PA4). Freestanding C (no libc), no division in the per-sample path, so
 * the same code runs in the overlay app and in the host test harness.
 *
 * Signal: 400 bps biphase-L, +/-1.1 rad phase modulation. The discriminator gives
 * dphi/dt (a pulse per phase flip); a leaky integrator rebuilds the phase
 * waveform, a DPLL on its zero crossings tracks the half-bit clock, and the
 * half-bit signs are matched against 13 preamble ones + frame sync, in both
 * polarities (the receive chain may invert). Bit n of the message (1-based, as in
 * C/S T.001) for n = 25..144 is then stored MSB first in bits[].
